# MazeRunner

---

Welcome to the **MazeRunner** project! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that covers basic search algorithms for **Path-Finding in a Maze**.

## Overview

In this notebook, you will explore various search algorithms to solve the problem of finding an escape path in a two-dimensional maze. The goal is to navigate from a *start* position to a *goal* position using different search strategies.

### Search Algorithms Covered

- **Uninformed Search Algorithms**
  - `breadth_first_search` (BFS)
  - `depth_first_search` (DFS)
  - `uniform_cost_search` (UCS)
  
- **Informed Search Algorithms**
  - `greedy_search`
  - `astar_search` (A*)
  
### Maze Setup

The maze is represented as a grid where each cell can either be open or blocked. The problem is to find the shortest or most cost-effective path from the *start* position to the *goal* position.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and open the notebook in your preferred environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MazeRunner.git
