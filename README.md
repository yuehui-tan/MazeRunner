# MazeRunner

---

Welcome to the **MazeRunner** project! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that covers basic search algorithms for **Path-Finding in a Maze**.

## Overview

In this notebook, you will explore various search algorithms to solve the problem of finding an escape path in a two-dimensional maze. The goal is to navigate from a *start* position to a *goal* position using different search strategies.

### Search Algorithms Covered

- **Uninformed Search Algorithms**
  - `breadth_first_search` (BFS)
  - `depth_first_search` (DFS)
  - `uniform_cost_search` (UCS)
  
- **Informed Search Algorithms**
  - `greedy_search`
  - `astar_search` (A*)
